There are two routines here, one to build the initial conditions of a composite galaxy according to the Hernquist method, another to integrate an N-Body system.

The initial conditions routine is found in "makegalaxy.cpp". It may be compiled with "make -f init.make" and run with ./init

The N-Body integrator is contained in "main.cpp". It can be compiled with "make -f nbd.make" and run with ./nbody

Enjoy!
